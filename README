Introduction to Fortran Debugging 
=================================

Programming is a complex process. Since it is done by human beings, errors may often occur. 
Debugging is the process of finding and resolving defects or problems within the program 
that prevent correct operation of computer software (called "bugs").
In order to fix these errors, first, we need to understand the what they are and how they can
occur. This tutorial reviews the most common types of errors and
present simple ways to locate and correct those errors without the use of any debugging applications.
The common errors are illustrated using simple Fortran applications where the simple debugging techniques
are applied.
